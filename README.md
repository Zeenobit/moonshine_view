Generic [Model/View](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) framework designed for [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) and the [Moonshine](https://github.com/Zeenobit/moonshine_core) save system.

## Overview

The Moonshine Save system is intentionally designed to encourage the user to separate the persistent game state (model) from its aesthetic elements (view). This provides a clear separation of concerns and has various benefits which are explained in detail in the [save framework](https://github.com/Zeenobit/moonshine_save#Philosophy) documentation.

An issue with this approach is that it adds additional complexity that the developer has to maintain. Typically, this involves manually de/spawning views associated with saved entities and synchronizing them with the game state via systems.

This crate aims to reduce some of this complexity by providing a more generic and ergonomic solution for synchronizing the game view with the game state.

## Usage

### Viewables

By definition, a [`Component`] is **Viewable** if a view can be built for it using [`BuildView`].

An [`Entity`] is **Viewable** if it has at least one component which implements [`BuildView`].

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;
use moonshine_view::prelude::*;

#[derive(Component)]
struct Bird;

impl BuildView for Bird {
    fn build(world: &World, object: Object<Self>, view: &mut ViewCommands<Self>) {
        let asset_server = world.resource::<AssetServer>();
        // ...
        for child in object.children() {
            // ...
        }
    }
}

// Remember to register viewable types:
let mut app = App::new();
app.register_viewable::<Bird>();
```

You may also define a [`Kind`] as viewable:

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;
use moonshine_core::prelude::*;
use moonshine_view::prelude::*;

#[derive(Component)]
struct Bird;

#[derive(Component)]
struct Monkey;

struct Creature;

impl Kind for Creature {
    type Filter = Or<(With<Bird>, With<Monkey>)>;
}

impl BuildView for Creature {
    fn build(world: &World, object: Object<Self>, view: &mut ViewCommands<Self>) {
        // All creatures look the same!
    }
}

// Remember to register viewable types:
let mut app = App::new();
app.register_viewable::<Creature>();
```

This is useful when you want to define the same view for multiple kinds of entities.

You may even define views polymorphically.

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;
use moonshine_core::prelude::*;
use moonshine_view::prelude::*;

#[derive(Component)]
struct Bird;

#[derive(Component)]
struct Monkey;

struct Creature;

impl Kind for Creature {
    type Filter = Or<(With<Bird>, With<Monkey>)>;
}

impl BuildView<Creature> for Bird {
    fn build(world: &World, object: Object<Creature>, view: &mut ViewCommands<Creature>) {
        // Birds look different, but they're still creatures!
    }
}

impl BuildView<Creature> for Monkey {
    fn build(world: &World, object: Object<Creature>, view: &mut ViewCommands<Creature>) {
        // Monkeys look different, but they're still creatures!
    }
}

// Polymorphic views are registered slightly differently:
let mut app = App::new();
app.register_view::<Creature, Bird>()
    .register_view::<Creature, Monkey>();
```

This is useful when you want to build a different version of the same view for multiple kinds of entities.

### Viewable ‚áÑ View

When a viewable entity is spawned, a **View Entity**.

A view entity is an entity with at least one [`View<T>`] component. Each [`View<T>`] is associated with its model entity via [`Viewable<T>`].

When a [`Viewable<T>`] is despawned, or if it is no longer of [`Kind`] `T`, the associated view entity is despawned with it.

Together, [`Viewable<T>`] and [`View<T>`] form a two-way link between the game state and the game view.

### Synchronization

At runtime, it is often required to update the view state based on the viewable state. For example, if an entity's position changes, so should the position of its view.

To solve this, consider using a system which either updates the view based on latest viewable state ("push") or queries the viewable from the view ("pull").

The "push" approach should be preferred because it often leads to less iterations per update cycle.

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;
use moonshine_view::prelude::*;

#[derive(Component)]
struct Bird;

impl BuildView for Bird {
    fn build(world: &World, object: Object<Self>, view: &mut ViewCommands<Self>) {
        // ...
    }
}

// Update view from viewable, if needed (preferred)
fn view_bird_changed(query: Query<(&Bird, &Viewable<Bird>), Changed<Bird>>) {
    for (bird, model) in query.iter() {
        let view = model.view();
        // ...
    }
}

// Query model from view constantly (typically less efficient)
fn view_bird(views: Query<&View<Bird>>, query: Query<&Bird, Changed<Bird>>) {
    for view in views.iter() {
        let viewable = view.viewable();
        if let Ok(bird) = query.get(viewable.entity()) {
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

The root view entity is automatically marked with [`Unload`].

This means the entire view entity hierarchy is despawned whenever a new game state is loaded.

### Untyped Viewables

Because the view system uses [`Kind`] for type safety, there is no access to views of a given viewable entity via a component.

Instead, you may query all views associated with an entity by using the `Viewables` resource:

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;
use moonshine_view::prelude::*;

fn update_views_generic(viewables: Res<Viewables>) {
    for viewable_entity in viewables.iter() {
        for view_entity in viewables.views(viewable_entity) {
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```
